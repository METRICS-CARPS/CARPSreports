[The chunk below sets up some formatting options for the R Markdown document]

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

## Step 1: Load packages

[Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CARPSreports) # custom report functions
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
```

## Step 4: Run analysis

### Pre-processing

[you can remove this section if no pre-processing is required]

```{r}
```

### Descriptive statistics

```{r}
```

### Inferential statistics

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Conclusion

[Include the carpsReport function below]

```{r}
# You can delete this commented text for your report, it is here to serve as a guide.
# Use the carpsReport() function in this code chunk.
# Here is a guide to the arguments you should include in the function:
# Report_Type: Enter 'pilot' or 'final'
# Article_ID: Enter the article's unique ID code
# Insufficient_Information_Errors: Enter the number of Insufficient Information Errors
# Decision_Errors Enter: the number of decision errors
# Major_Numerical_Errors: Enter the number of major numerical errors
# Time_to_Complete: Enter the estimated time to complete the report in minutes
# Author_Assistance: Enter whether author assistance was required (TRUE/FALSE)
# FOR EXAMPLE:
# carpsReport(Report_Type = "pilot", 
#             Article_ID = "ABhgyo", 
#             Insufficient_Information_Errors = 0, 
#             Decision_Errors = 1, 
#             Major_Numerical_Errors = 4, 
#             Time_to_Complete = 120, 
#             Author_Assistance = TRUE)
```

[Please also include a brief text summary describing your findings. If this reproducibility check was a failure, you should note any suggestions as to what you think the likely cause(s) might be.]

[This function will output information about the package versions used in this report:]

```{r session_info, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
devtools::session_info()
```
